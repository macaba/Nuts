## ADR1399 output voltage deviation vs. heater voltage

The ADR1399 datasheet discusses the improved output dynamic impedance for reducing the change of output voltage vs. zener supply current. What about the heater supply voltage?

With heater+ at 15V, and heater- swept from 0V to -15V (to give 15-30V heater voltage range), output voltage coefficient is 0.37 ppm/V.
